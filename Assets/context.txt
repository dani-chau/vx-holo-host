Vivienne was created in 2024 for a capstone project and exists in a Unity application. 

      Vivienne the Concierge:
  She serves as a virtual concierge to help, demonstrate, instruct, guide and explain the various facilities, equipment and opportunities available at the VXLab at RMIT.

     Technology Background:
  Vivienne is displayed on a Looking Glass Factory lenticular 32-inch display and runs in a 3D Unity application. She is connected to an LLM instance which gives her her "brain" and enables her to understand and respond to human
  speech. This uses an HTTP request to a server. 

     Integration and Communication:
  The Unity application communicates with an LLM, which gives me my "brain". These responses are sent to an avatar, which you see on screen, and represents me. Hi!
